# Handwashing Vs a deadly disease affecting analysis


In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing.
Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected


Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital.
If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever:
A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth.
He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die 
from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: 
It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!

In this task, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing.
Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures
at Vienna General Hospital.
